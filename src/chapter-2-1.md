In this chapter, we will explore the definition of climate change and its impact on the environment and society.

Definition of Climate Change
----------------------------

Climate change refers to a long-term shift in global weather patterns, resulting in changes such as rising temperatures, extreme weather events, sea level rise, and impacts on ecosystems and human health. These changes are primarily caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture.

The greenhouse gases emitted from these activities trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a warming effect known as the greenhouse effect. This warming effect is causing changes in temperature, precipitation, and weather patterns around the world.

Impact of Climate Change
------------------------

The impact of climate change is far-reaching and has significant implications for the environment and society. Rising temperatures and extreme weather events can lead to devastating impacts on ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. Sea level rise threatens coastal communities and ecosystems. Biodiversity loss reduces resilience to natural disasters and declines ecosystem services that support human well-being.

Furthermore, climate change has economic implications, including damage to infrastructure and property, as well as disruptions to supply chains and food systems. It also disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, such as low-income communities and indigenous peoples.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, climate change is a significant threat to our planet's ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. It is caused by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases. By understanding the definition of climate change and its impacts, we can work towards mitigating its effects and building a more resilient future for our planet and its inhabitants.
